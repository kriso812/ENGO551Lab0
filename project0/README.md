5 html pages
Headers have a class myHeader styled in styles.css
index.html has 5 buttons which will take you to any other pages, also present on all other pages. These buttons are from bootstrap 4.
index.html has the @media query, should change the text when the window is smaller
page1.html has an ordered list, with unordered list inside, styled using SCSS nesting, along with an image
page2.html has a table, styled in the styles.css
page3.html has a form, partially styled using SCSS. The messages on this page are styled using inheritance in SCSS
page4.html has a bootstrap 4 table with 3 columns
styles.css contains a lot of different properties, and a few different kinds of selectors, some of these would get overriden by SCSS styling.
